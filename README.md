## üîñ Description

3 HTML components to test my skills.

## üìñ How-to

Open `./src/index.html` to display all components. In order to code faster `live-server` package is used to refresh the browser automatically after every change.

Web styling is made with [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) and keeping in mind [7-1 Sass Architecture](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/user-interfaces/building-layouts-preprocessors/7-1-sass-architecture) and [BEM pattern](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/).

To bundle all stylesheets use `npm run compile:sass`. Mind this command will run as a `watcher`.

All images are located in `./src/assets/images/`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Binary files as images are managed with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## Component 1Ô∏è‚É£
